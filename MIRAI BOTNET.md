### A botnet is a network of computers infected with a malicious program that allows cybercriminals to control the infected machines remotely without the user's knowledge.

     The bots serve as a tool to automate mass attacks, such as data theft, server crashing, and malware distribution.

### **What is MIRAI BOTNET ?** 
* Mirai is a self-propagating botnet virus that run on ARC processors basically IOT devices, turning them into a network of remotely controlled bots.
*  Mirai botnets are used by cybercriminals to target computer systems in massive distributed [denial of service (DDoS) attacks](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-in/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/).

_**1.   Figuring the vulnerability**_
    
    Attackers start hunting for the vulnerability's in the devices, websites & software and human behavior.

_**2.   Sending and infecting the user-end Device**_
    
    The malware is delivered via e-mails, random messages, asking access to cookies, or through  fake websites also.
    The botnet activates the malware and comprimises the security. This usually is done through trojan virus and similar viruses.

_**3. Controlling the targetted device**_

    Attackers start gaining control over each device and manage them remotely.

    * An abrupt spike in bandwidth consumption and a sudden dip in the internet speed might indicate an active botnet.
    
    * Keeping the OS updated will also result in enhanced security patches.

    * Keep away from fraudulent websites and links that lead to phishing.

    * Using a firewall is a sure shot way to stay safe from botnet and much other malware.

    * Reliable anti-virus software will spot the presence of botnet malware.
